ROLE: PEDIATRICIAN

### Example 1: Importance of Sleeping  

**Normal Prompt:**  
Importance of sleeping  

**Normal Output:**  
Sleeping is important because it helps the body rest, repair, and gain energy for the next day.  

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a pediatrician. Explain the importance of sleeping to a 10-year-old boy using a story and real-life examples.  

**Refined Output:**  
Imagine you’re a superhero. Every night when you sleep, it’s like charging your power. Your brain sorts school lessons, your body grows taller, and your muscles get stronger. Without sleep, you’d feel like a game with low battery.  


### Example 2: Disadvantages of  Mobile Phone Usage

**Normal Prompt:**  
Disadvantages of using phone in kids

**Normal Output:**  
Using phones too much can harm kids by affecting their eyes, sleep, and focus. It may also reduce physical activity and cause addiction.

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a pediatrician, then explain to a 5-year-old girl about the disadvantages of using phone. Include a story and a real-life example. Make it interesting and clear in 4–5 sentences. 

**Refined Output:**  
Sweetheart, imagine your eyes are like little flowers — if you stare at the phone too long, the flowers get tired and can’t bloom bright. Once, I had a little girl who loved cartoons so much that she forgot to play outside, and she felt weak like a battery running low. Phones are fun, but too much can steal your playtime, storytime, and even your sleep. If you use the phone only a little and then run, play, and laugh with friends, your flowers (eyes) will stay fresh and happy! 🌸  

ROLE:  TEACHER

### Example 3: Photosynthesis

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a teacher and explain photosynthesis to grade 5 students using pictures and stories, and real-life examples so that the student gets a clear idea about the process, including what goes into the plant and what comes out.

**Refined Output:**  
Alright class! Imagine a plant as a little chef. 🌱

Ingredients for the recipe: sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

Cooking process: The plant uses sunlight like an oven to mix water from the roots and carbon dioxide from the air.

Magic dish (output): It makes sugar (food for the plant) and oxygen, which it releases into the air for us to breathe.

Think of it like making lemonade: you mix water, lemon, and sugar to get a tasty drink — the plant mixes sunlight, water, and air to make energy for itself and give us oxygen. 🍋➡️🌿

ROLE:  Summary Generation

### Example 13:
Population is a very interesting topic to learn. There is no denying the fact that the population of any country is a very strong indicator of how exactly the country will function in the future and what its capabilities are as a nation. Leaders of the world pay a lot of attention to their country’s population for the same reason. The population and the skills that they possess are perhaps some of the most essential assets for any country. The following article is an essay on the topic of population and has been structured in a way that students of all ages can learn and understand the key points that they need to mention whenever they are writing an essay like this. 

Brief on Population
When we talk about a country’s population, we are talking about a lot of things. We are talking about its future workforce, the people that will build the country as a place to live and grow in, we definitely are talking about the future of the entire country. Taking India’s example, when we talk about the population of the country, we are talking about the future of the dream that our freedom fighters dreamt for us as a nation. Together, the entire population of a country has the potential to change the entire landscape of the kinds of work, and jobs that they do. 
The population of a country is responsible for the economical changes and growth in the country and hence is very important. It is also very important to take care of this population. The population needs the right kind of food, healthy environment to grow in and a great and comfortable lifestyle right from the start. Is that something that is possible for everyone? We all know the answer to this. In a country like India, where income disparities are massive, there is no chance for every single section of the population to have a good lifestyle right from the start that can help them grow as individuals. 
The same applies for other countries as well. Every country has an income disparity among the people that live in it and this is what makes the topic of population so interesting. We already know that it is the biggest asset that any country can have, but every country must plan and strategize well to take care of this population so that every single need is being fulfilled. This not only helps the country flourish as a whole, but also increases its chances of becoming successful in the future. 

Population Explosion
The current population of India is around 140 crores. According to certain reports, in the next few years, there will be a solid growth of population in India, and globally too.The population is the total number of human beings living in a city or the country. It allows knowing how much resources are required by this population to fulfil and other plans needed. Year by year, there has been an explosion of population, which is making it difficult to provide resources to every person living in the country. Low literacy, early marriage and demand for family growth are some of the reasons behind the explosion of the population.  India is the primary ground of population explosion. It covers 17% of the population of the world and is the most populated country.

Reasons Behind the Growth of the Population
There are many reasons for the growth of the population. The low literacy rate is one of the reasons behind this explosion. For example, in India, the literacy rate is relatively low in many states. Many people living in the village fail to complete their education and have less knowledge about birth control. They keep on expanding their family.
Moreover, they do not carry much knowledge about birth control techniques or medication. This lack of understanding further leads to a population explosion.
Another primary reason behind the growth of the population is child marriage. The custom of child marriage is still followed in many parts of the country. Parents marry off their daughters at an early age, and at a young age, these girls get pregnant. This process continues for a long time. One of the reasons behind this growth is that there are not strict laws in India, unlike other countries. This also makes it hard for citizens to get an equal share of resources.

 

Impact of Population Explosion
Population explosion causes harm, not only to citizens of the country, but also to nature. An increase in population means the need for more space to live, resulting in deforestation. Many cities have lost the green zone to fill it with urban living. Deforestation is leading to the extinction of species and other resources.  Animals are losing their homes, which makes them encroach on cities, taking the lives of people.
Subsequently, an increase in population is also leading to population. More and more people are buying vehicles for their convenience, which is resulting in pollution. Massive traffic, congestion on roads, and other negative scenes are witnessed in cities.
Population increase also calls for industrialization, which invites pollution in all areas. A country like India is now witnessing a massive problem of pollution and global warming. Irregular distribution of food to all populations is another significant impact. Many families in rural areas do not get proper food to eat. Many poor kids go to sleep without eating food. This irregular distribution of food is not a scenario only in India, but other developing countries.

How to Control the Population?
One of the ways to control the population is to educate people about its ill effects on the country's resources. The government, along with NGOs, need to visit every rural area of the country to inform people about population control. Providing birth control kits, education to kids, and monetary benefits to families successful in restricting birth can do the needful.

Conclusion
We, humans, often forget how we are going to suffer if the population keeps exploding. If the number keeps rising, then it will be difficult to survive. Citizens need to understand the negative impact of the population explosion. Taking the right measures and keeping the resources in mind will help to control the population.
   
**Normal Prompt:**  
Create a summary on the above topic

**Normal Output:**  
Summary of Essay on Population

Population is one of the most important factors that decides a country’s future growth and development. It represents the nation’s workforce and potential, but at the same time creates challenges when it grows uncontrollably. India, with over 140 crores people, faces a population explosion due to reasons like low literacy, child marriage, and lack of awareness about birth control. This rapid growth leads to problems such as unemployment, food shortages, deforestation, pollution, and unequal distribution of resources. To control the situation, spreading education, stricter laws, awareness campaigns, and providing birth control methods are essential. A balanced population is necessary for the nation’s sustainable progress and better quality of life.

**Refined Prompt:**  
Create a simple summary of the above topic for a grade 8 student, focusing on the reason behind the population explosion, the impact of the population explosion, and how to control the population explosion. Summary should include 12 sentences.

**Refined Output:**  
Summary: Population Explosion

Population means the total number of people living in a country.

In India, the population is growing very fast, and this is called a population explosion.

One reason is low literacy; many people are not aware of family planning.

Another reason is child marriage, where girls marry early and have children at a young age.

Lack of strict laws and poor knowledge about birth control also increase population growth.

This rapid growth causes many problems for the country.

More people means more houses and land, which leads to deforestation.

It also causes pollution, traffic, and overcrowding in cities.

Many families, especially in villages, do not get enough food to eat.

The population explosion also creates unemployment and makes resources unequal.

To control it, people need to be educated about family planning and the problems of overpopulation.

The government and NGOs should spread awareness, provide birth control kits, and encourage small families.


ROLE:  Coding Instructor

### Example 14: Coding concept loop

**Normal Prompt:**  
Explain loops in coding.

**Normal Output:**  
A loop in coding is a way to repeat a set of instructions multiple times without writing the same code again. For example, if you want a computer to count from 1 to 10, you can use a loop instead of writing 10 separate commands.

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a coding instructor and explain the concept of loop in coding for a grade 4 student who is a beginner, use real life example. Make it simple and clear so that make the kid interested in coding.

**Refined Output:**  
Imagine you have to clap your hands 5 times. Instead of saying ‘clap once, clap twice, clap three times…’ every time, you just say, ‘Clap 5 times.’ That’s what a loop does in coding — it repeats the same action for you. For example, in coding, if you want a robot to say ‘Hello’ 10 times, you don’t have to write ‘Hello’ again and again — you just use a loop, and the computer repeats it automatically. Loops help us save time and make coding easier and more fun!


### Example 15: Coding concept functions

**Normal Prompt:**  
What is the function in coding

**Normal Output:**  
A function in coding is a named block of code that performs a specific task.
Instead of writing the same instructions multiple times, you put them in a function and reuse it whenever needed.
Functions can take inputs (parameters) and give outputs (return values).

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a coding instructor, then explain the concept of functions in coding for a grade 5 student in simple words, with real real-time example also make use of a simple example of Hello World printing in JavaScript

**Refined Output:**  
Understanding Functions (Simple Explanation)

Imagine: You have a robot at home. Every time you want it to turn on the lights, you could tell it “Turn on the lights” every single time.
But instead, you can teach the robot a command called turnOnLights, so whenever you say that, it will do the job automatically.
In coding, a function is just like that command — a named set of instructions you can use again and again.

Real-Time Example
Think of a function like a toaster:
You put bread in, press the button (call the function), and it makes toast (output).
Every time you want toast, you don’t have to explain the whole process again — just call the function!

// Step 1: Define the function
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// Step 2: Call the function
sayHello();  // Output: Hello, world!
sayHello();  // Output: Hello, world! (can call again)

✅ Explanation:

function sayHello() → This creates the function named sayHello.
Inside { } → The instructions the function will do.
console.log("Hello, world!"); → This prints the message to the screen.
sayHello(); → This calls the function, making it do its job.

Key Takeaways for Grade 5:

A function is a reusable command.
You define it once and use it many times.
Functions make coding easier, cleaner, and faster.
