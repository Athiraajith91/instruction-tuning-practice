Project Title: AI Career Counselor â€“ Role-Based Prompt Refinement Project
## Project Overview
This project explores how refined prompt design can help an AI act as a career counselor who guides users based on their interests, not just by giving one-line answers.  
The goal is to demonstrate how **instruction tuning** and **multi-turn prompts** can produce more human-like, thoughtful career guidance.

## Objectives
- Design effective **role-based prompts** for an AI counselor.
- Use **multi-turn conversation** to collect user information before suggesting careers.
- Demonstrate **before vs. after refinement** to show improvement in AI reasoning and tone.
