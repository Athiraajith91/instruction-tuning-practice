Act as a pediatrician. Explain the importance of sleeping to a 10-year-old boy using a story and real-life examples.  

**Refined Output:**  
Imagine you’re a superhero. Every night when you sleep, it’s like charging your power. Your brain sorts school lessons, your body grows taller, and your muscles get stronger. Without sleep, you’d feel like a game with low battery.  


### Example 2: Disadvantages of  Mobile Phone Usage

**Normal Prompt:**  
Disadvantages of using phone in kids

Using phones too much can harm kids by affecting their eyes, sleep, and focus. It may also reduce physical activity and cause addiction.

Act as a pediatrician, then explain to a 5-year-old girl about the disadvantages of using phone. Include a story and a real-life example. Make it interesting and clear in 4–5 sentences.

Sweetheart, imagine your eyes are like little flowers — if you stare at the phone too long, the flowers get tired and can’t bloom bright. Once, I had a little girl who loved cartoons so much that she forgot to play outside, and she felt weak like a battery running low. Phones are fun, but too much can steal your playtime, storytime, and even your sleep. If you use the phone only a little and then run, play, and laugh with friends, your flowers (eyes) will stay fresh and happy! 🌸

**Refined Output:**  
Alright class! Imagine a plant as a little chef. 🌱

Ingredients for the recipe: sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

Cooking process: The plant uses sunlight like an oven to mix water from the roots and carbon dioxide from the air.

Farmers, doctors, and even we students depend on this treasure for food, medicine, and clean air. Protecting the Ghats is like protecting our own life support system.
