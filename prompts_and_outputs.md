ROLE:  PEDIATRICIAN

### Example 1: Importance of Sleeping  

**Normal Prompt:**  
Importance of sleeping  

**Normal Output:**  
Sleeping is important because it helps the body rest, repair, and gain energy for the next day.  

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a pediatrician. Explain the importance of sleeping to a 10-year-old boy using a story and real-life examples.  

**Refined Output:**  
Imagine you’re a superhero. Every night when you sleep, it’s like charging your power. Your brain sorts school lessons, your body grows taller, and your muscles get stronger. Without sleep, you’d feel like a game with low battery.  


### Example 2: Disadvantages of  Mobile Phone Usage

**Normal Prompt:**  
Disadvantages of using phone in kids

**Normal Output:**  
Using phones too much can harm kids by affecting their eyes, sleep, and focus. It may also reduce physical activity and cause addiction.

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a pediatrician, then explain to a 5-year-old girl about the disadvantages of using phone. Include a story and a real-life example. Make it interesting and clear in 4–5 sentences. 

**Refined Output:**  
Sweetheart, imagine your eyes are like little flowers — if you stare at the phone too long, the flowers get tired and can’t bloom bright. Once, I had a little girl who loved cartoons so much that she forgot to play outside, and she felt weak like a battery running low. Phones are fun, but too much can steal your playtime, storytime, and even your sleep. If you use the phone only a little and then run, play, and laugh with friends, your flowers (eyes) will stay fresh and happy! 🌸  

ROLE:  TEACHER

### Example 1: Photosynthesis  

**Normal Prompt:**  
what is photosynthesis 

**Normal Output:**  
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make their own food and release oxygen. 

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a teacher and explain photosynthesis to grade 5 students using pictures and stories, and real-life examples so that the student gets a clear idea about the process, including what goes into the plant and what comes out.

**Refined Output:**  
Alright class! Imagine a plant as a little chef. 🌱

Ingredients for the recipe: sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

Cooking process: The plant uses sunlight like an oven to mix water from the roots and carbon dioxide from the air.

Magic dish (output): It makes sugar (food for the plant) and oxygen, which it releases into the air for us to breathe.

Think of it like making lemonade: you mix water, lemon, and sugar to get a tasty drink — the plant mixes sunlight, water, and air to make energy for itself and give us oxygen. 🍋➡️🌿
