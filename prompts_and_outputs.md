ROLE:  PEDIATRICIAN

### Example 1: Importance of Sleeping  

**Normal Prompt:**  
Importance of sleeping  

**Normal Output:**  
Sleeping is important because it helps the body rest, repair, and gain energy for the next day.  

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a pediatrician. Explain the importance of sleeping to a 10-year-old boy using a story and real-life examples.  

**Refined Output:**  
Imagine youâ€™re a superhero. Every night when you sleep, itâ€™s like charging your power. Your brain sorts school lessons, your body grows taller, and your muscles get stronger. Without sleep, youâ€™d feel like a game with low battery.  


### Example 2: Disadvantages of  Mobile Phone Usage

**Normal Prompt:**  
Disadvantages of using phone in kids

**Normal Output:**  
Using phones too much can harm kids by affecting their eyes, sleep, and focus. It may also reduce physical activity and cause addiction.

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a pediatrician, then explain to a 5-year-old girl about the disadvantages of using phone. Include a story and a real-life example. Make it interesting and clear in 4â€“5 sentences. 

**Refined Output:**  
Sweetheart, imagine your eyes are like little flowers â€” if you stare at the phone too long, the flowers get tired and canâ€™t bloom bright. Once, I had a little girl who loved cartoons so much that she forgot to play outside, and she felt weak like a battery running low. Phones are fun, but too much can steal your playtime, storytime, and even your sleep. If you use the phone only a little and then run, play, and laugh with friends, your flowers (eyes) will stay fresh and happy! ðŸŒ¸
