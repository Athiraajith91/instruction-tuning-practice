ROLE:  PEDIATRICIAN

### Example 1: Importance of Sleeping  

**Normal Prompt:**  
Importance of sleeping  

**Normal Output:**  
Sleeping is important because it helps the body rest, repair, and gain energy for the next day.  

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a pediatrician. Explain the importance of sleeping to a 10-year-old boy using a story and real-life examples.  

**Refined Output:**  
Imagine you’re a superhero. Every night when you sleep, it’s like charging your power. Your brain sorts school lessons, your body grows taller, and your muscles get stronger. Without sleep, you’d feel like a game with low battery.  


### Example 2: Disadvantages of  Mobile Phone Usage

**Normal Prompt:**  
Disadvantages of using phone in kids

**Normal Output:**  
Using phones too much can harm kids by affecting their eyes, sleep, and focus. It may also reduce physical activity and cause addiction.

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a pediatrician, then explain to a 5-year-old girl about the disadvantages of using phone. Include a story and a real-life example. Make it interesting and clear in 4–5 sentences. 

**Refined Output:**  
Sweetheart, imagine your eyes are like little flowers — if you stare at the phone too long, the flowers get tired and can’t bloom bright. Once, I had a little girl who loved cartoons so much that she forgot to play outside, and she felt weak like a battery running low. Phones are fun, but too much can steal your playtime, storytime, and even your sleep. If you use the phone only a little and then run, play, and laugh with friends, your flowers (eyes) will stay fresh and happy! 🌸  

ROLE:  TEACHER

### Example 1: Photosynthesis  

**Normal Prompt:**  
what is photosynthesis 

**Normal Output:**  
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make their own food and release oxygen. 

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a teacher and explain photosynthesis to grade 5 students using pictures and stories, and real-life examples so that the student gets a clear idea about the process, including what goes into the plant and what comes out.

**Refined Output:**  
Alright class! Imagine a plant as a little chef. 🌱

Ingredients for the recipe: sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

Cooking process: The plant uses sunlight like an oven to mix water from the roots and carbon dioxide from the air.

Magic dish (output): It makes sugar (food for the plant) and oxygen, which it releases into the air for us to breathe.

Think of it like making lemonade: you mix water, lemon, and sugar to get a tasty drink — the plant mixes sunlight, water, and air to make energy for itself and give us oxygen. 🍋➡️🌿


### Example 2: Solar eclipse

**Normal Prompt:**  
what is solar eclipse

**Normal Output:**  
A solar eclipse happens when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun’s light either partly or fully for a short time.

**Refined Prompt:**  
Act as a teacher and explain solar eclipse to a grade 6 student, make the explanation interesting by adding a real life example and don’t extend beyond 5 sentences, make it clear and easy to understand.

**Refined Output:**  
A solar eclipse happens when the Moon comes in front of the Sun and blocks its light from reaching Earth. 🌑☀️
It’s like when a friend stands in front of the projector in class — the screen suddenly goes dark. 🎥
Sometimes the Moon covers the Sun fully (total eclipse), and sometimes only partly (partial eclipse).
This event doesn’t last long, but it looks amazing because the sky gets darker even in the daytime.
Remember: never look directly at the Sun during an eclipse, always use special glasses! 🕶️
