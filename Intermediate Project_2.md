Project Title: The Negotiation Coach

Overview
The Negotiation Coach is an instruction-tuning practice project designed to simulate how an AI mediator adapts to different personas — Empathetic Mediator, HR Professional, and Logical Analyst — when resolving workplace disagreements.
This project demonstrates how instruction tuning and prompt design can shape tone, reasoning, and output style while keeping factual consistency.

Objectives
Experiment with multi-persona prompt tuning.
Learn to balance emotion, policy, and logic in conflict resolution.
Build a small synthetic dataset for instruction evaluation.

Personas
 1. Empathetic Mediator	Focuses on emotional understanding. Warm, validating
 2. HR Professional	follows fairness and policy. Neutral, procedural
 3. Logical Analyst	Uses cause–and–effect reasoning. Analytical, factual
